Hey, what's up! My name is Raynell, I am an Email Developer who brings a unique blend of technical expertise and a deep love for music and vinyl records. My journey in email development began with a fascination for how art and technology intersect, much like the grooves on a vinyl record. I've honed my skills in crafting pixel-perfect email campaigns while staying true to my musical roots.

When I'm not coding emails, you can find me flipping through stacks of vinyl records at local record shops, hunting for hidden gems and lost classics. I believe that, much like a thoughtfully curated vinyl collection, email campaigns should offer a finely tailored experience for the audience, seamlessly blending creativity and precision to make a lasting impact.

I'm thrilled to combine my enthusiasm for creativity with my email development expertise to craft compelling and seamless email campaigns that connect with your audience. Let's collaborate to transform your email marketing initiatives into a harmonious journey toward success.
