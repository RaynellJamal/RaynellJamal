Hey, what's up! My name is Raynell, I am an Email Developer who brings a unique blend of technical expertise and a deep love for music and vinyl records. My journey in email development began with a fascination for how art and technology intersect, much like the grooves on a vinyl record. I've honed my skills in crafting pixel-perfect email campaigns while staying true to my musical roots.

When I'm not coding and designing emails, you can find me flipping through stacks of vinyl records at local record shops, searching for hidden gems and lost classics. Just like a well-curated vinyl collection, email campaigns should be a carefully curated experience for the audience, blending creativity and precision to strike a chord.

I'm excited to merge my passion for music with my email development skills to create engaging and harmonious email campaigns that resonate with audiences. Let's work together to turn your email marketing efforts into a symphony of success.
